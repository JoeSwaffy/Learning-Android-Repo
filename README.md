 # Learning Android Repo
<center><h1>Hey There!</h1></center>
<hr />
<p>My name is Joseph Swafford (Joe Swaffy), I'm a self taught programmer and I've been programming as a hobby since I was 
in grade school. I'm now 25 and want to take programming seriously. I have never tried to apply for a job and have no "real" experience
other than my own self taught obssessive studies. Through this github account I hope to build a good portfolio so that I can make the 
jump from hobbyist to freelancer and then hopefully to full time employment. I have experience in web development, java, python and various
other languages though I've spent most of my time learning java. This particular repo is a series of me learning to make android apps
for the first time (with my pre-established java experience it was an easy leap). This repo will also contain my first attempt at learning 
kotlin. This will be the base for me getting used to github and ultimately to making a kickass portfolio website which links back
to some cool stuff i publish on here! In the mean time, take a look at my learning experience into android app development!</p>
